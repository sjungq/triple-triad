# triple triad

Clone of the Triple Triad minigame in the Final Fantasy franchise, specifically following the implementation of the game in Final Fantasy XIV

Still a work in progress; hosted on [tripletriad.sjungq.com](https://tripletriad.sjungq.com).

Basic Rules from the [official NA FFXIV website](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/contentsguide/goldsaucer/tripletriad/):

1. Two players take turns placing cards on a three-by-three grid.
2. The player who goes first is decided at random.
3. When it is your turn, you must place a card on one of the open spaces on the grid.
4. When a card is placed, the numbers representing its four sides are compared to any adjacent cards. If a number on the card placed is greater than the number it faces on an adjacent card, you will flip that card and capture it.
5. The objective is to capture and control more cards than your opponent. After nine cards have been played, the player who controls more cards is the winner. Note that the unplayed 10th card is also counted.
